## 🔍 What I Uncovered

Through SQL querying and visual analysis, I discovered valuable insights about pizza sales performance:

- 🍕 **Classic pizzas** and **Large sizes** are the most popular and best-performing categories
- 📅 **Fridays** consistently have the highest order volume, especially in evening hours
- 🕒 Most orders are placed between **6 PM – 8 PM**
- ❌ The **Brie Carre Pizza** had the lowest sales performance across all timeframes
- 📉 Order surges during weekends signal staffing & inventory optimization needs
- 📈 Customers tend to order **multiple pizzas per order**, with averages over 2

These insights can help guide:
- Menu decisions and marketing promotions
- Resource planning and peak-time staffing
- Product placement in campaigns
